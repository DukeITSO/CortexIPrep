This is an analyzer for [Cortex](https://github.com/CERT-BDF/Cortex/blob/master/README.md). It will do IP address lookups against the packetmail.net (Punch++) IP reputation service.

To install, place these files in a new directory (such as "CortexIPrep") under your Cortex Analyzers directory.

Configure the Analyzer within the Cortex Interface; you must provide an API key for this to work correctly.

Please report any issues or feature requests here!
